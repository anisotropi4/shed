This is a retrospective of my 30 Day Map Challenge. In a reckless moment on the 1^st^ November 2025 I thought I would have a go a making a few maps and see how far I'd get to before stopiing. Some four-and-a-bit weeks later, this is what I got and the associated social-media [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/deck/@wnd) toots.

## [2025-11-01 "Points"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115476758004810874)

In a vain attempt for #30MapsInAMonth here is a "Eurocentric" world map EPSG:3034 equal area projection using on [WorldPopProject]() 1km² data showing projected population change between 2020 and 2030.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the second #30MapsInAMonth here is a map showing the heavy-rail network track-model and stations centred on the East Coast Mainline between South Yorkshire and the Fens. This uses the Rail Data Marketplace centre-line track-model published by Network Rail and the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) list of active stations.

## 2025-11-02 Outro to the Intro 

As I then said [at the time:](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115481179128707599)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I'm never sure about this, but this year I decided to prepare for the #30DayMapChallenge by looking at things I have mapped over the years. My conclusion is I suffer from a rather myopic approach to the topic I visualise... #rail #Infrastructure #population #Europe

Followed by the revelation that there was [a bit more to this than I had thought:](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115481320820744649)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I've now discovered that there are meant to be "themes" for each day in the #30DayMapChallenge but as that's beyond me, it looks like I will be running a #fringe event instead...

## [2025-11-03 "Polygons"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115484726949074623)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the third #30MapsInAMonth are three theoretical European full-automated luxury high-speed heavy-rail network maps based on population distribution. This uses H3 hierarchical hexagon library to aggregate @WorldPopProject population data into #polygons, creating a maximum spanning tree network using population-to-population edge-weights and names for major urban centres added using @EUCommission  Global Human Settlement Layer data.

For the fourth #30MapsInAMonth is a map also based on population distribution and the shortest walking route to routes from the 2021 Office for National Statistics census Output Area locations to the stations centred on Sheffield. The line width is proportional to the aggregated population and the routes are based on based on @openstreetmap path data, and the station locations on Office of Rail and Road (ORR) active station list

For the twenty eighth #30MapsInAMonth are two visualisations based on the [UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI)](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/) showing total and transport air pollution and emissions.

For the twenty ninth #30MapsInAMonth are two visualisations based on the [WorldPopProject]() 2030 projected population as 100m² raster data. The first shows the population of the Islands of Northern Europe and the second population change.

## [2025-11-30 "Makeover"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115638218182948704)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the thirtieth* #30MapsInAMonth are maps showing the electrification of the global heavy-rail network based on the track-model and electrification and electrification tags from @openstreetmap

An electric railway is the least carbon-intensive way of moving freight and passengers over long distances**. More so where the electricity generation is from renewable sources.

\* and final

** words chosen more carefully

While my plan was to make a global full-automated luxury high-speed railway for the final day, I chose to makeover the electrification maps because they seemed to be of most interest to people. 

Outwith the ORR ODM data map and they will get updated once next FY year's data is published...

## [2025-11-30 Outro to the Outro](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115638242713133373)

This has been hard work and probably took up more time than it should have. I have learnt stuff, and done bigger things that I had thought I could. Then again, quite a lot of what I had first thought I would post, I haven't often because it didn't fit the theme.

I also found myself at a point about a third-of-the-way through where I decided to get stuff made ahead of time. Which was good as it meant I finished the whole piece and had things to say each day that vaguely fitted the theme.

However, this didn't help with the actual daily posting itself. Where a combination of social-media file-size and resolution limits, my inability to articulate what it is that I have just done in words, a wish to post insanely large images and the general [yak-shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) of getting animations to work was probably the hardest part for me. No fun. Making things that are nice to look at, learning new stuff, and the general interaction and feedback kind makes it worth it though.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
After a brief period of activity, where I have posted a lot of maps for a month, I now plan to return to my usual approach of mostly ignoring posting anything unless I really have to.
