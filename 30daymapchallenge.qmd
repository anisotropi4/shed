This is a retrospective of my 30 Day Map Challenge. In a reckless moment on the 1^st^ November 2025 I thought I would have a go a making a few maps and see how far I'd get to before stopiing. Some four-and-a-bit weeks later, this is what I got and the associated social-media [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/deck/@wnd) toots.

## Week 1

### [2025-11-01 "Points"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115476758004810874) 

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
In a vain attempt for #30MapsInAMonth here is a "Eurocentric" world map EPSG:3034 equal area projection using on [WorldPopProject]() 1km² data showing projected population change between 2020 and 2030.

### [2025-11-02 "Lines"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115479839907939776) 

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the second #30MapsInAMonth here is a map showing the heavy-rail network track-model and stations centred on the East Coast Mainline between South Yorkshire and the Fens. This uses the Rail Data Marketplace centre-line track-model published by Network Rail and the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) list of active stations.

### 2025-11-02 Outro to the Intro 

As I then said [at the time:](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115481179128707599)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I'm never sure about this, but this year I decided to prepare for the #30DayMapChallenge by looking at things I have mapped over the years. My conclusion is I suffer from a rather myopic approach to the topic I visualise... #rail #Infrastructure #population #Europe

:::

Followed by the revelation that there was [a bit more to this than I had thought:](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115481320820744649)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I've now discovered that there are meant to be "themes" for each day in the #30DayMapChallenge but as that's beyond me, it looks like I will be running a #fringe event instead...

### [2025-11-03 "Polygons"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115484726949074623)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the third #30MapsInAMonth are three theoretical European full-automated luxury high-speed heavy-rail network maps based on population distribution. This uses H3 hierarchical hexagon library to aggregate @WorldPopProject population data into #polygons, creating a maximum spanning tree network using population-to-population edge-weights and names for major urban centres added using @EUCommission  Global Human Settlement Layer data.

For the fourth #30MapsInAMonth is a map also based on population distribution and the shortest walking route to routes from the 2021 Office for National Statistics census Output Area locations to the stations centred on Sheffield. The line width is proportional to the aggregated population and the routes are based on based on @openstreetmap path data, and the station locations on Office of Rail and Road (ORR) active station list

## Week 4

### Intro to the Outro

It was at this point that I could then see the end and had something prepared for everything outwith "Black" and "Makeover".

I had a steer on "Black" based on air-pollution data from the [UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI)](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/).

My thought for the "Makeover" was to then redo the [Fully Automated Luxury European High-Speed Railway from 2025-11-03](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115484726949074623) but went with a recut with a global electrification map. Which was more popular then the theoretical high-speed rail map, and vox populari vox dei and all that.

### [2025-11-24 "Places and names"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115603864392138531)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the twenty third #30MapsInAMonth here is a map that shows the stations where the aggregated number of people living within the shortest walking distance to a heavy rail station is greater that 50k. The station name is scaled based on this aggregated number.

![](30-day/24/hinterland-station-06.png){fig-align=center width=80% fig-alt="" .lightbox}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I find it interesting that, although there is a higher population in the South East and North West, this would suggest relatively fewer stations serving the population along the route of the Midlands Main Line (MML) or in the North East around the Tyne and Tees.

#### [2025-11-26 Hardest Visualisation](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115604095777796208)

This visualation caused the most debate its means, where I found it useful to refer to the post where

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
(It's based on a dataset where I worked out the shortest walking distances from the OA census and/or WorldPop 1km2 centroids data to heavy rail stations to end up with a [watershed diagram as shared earlier](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115558909793335614) If you then add up the population served by station and rank them, you get this...)

### [2025-11-25 "Hexagons"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115609670872835531)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the twenty fifth #30MapsInAMonth are a series of six maps showing [WorldPopProject]() 1km² population data aggregated into a hierarchical set of scaled hexagons.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the twenty sixth #30MapsInAMonth is a visualisation using the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) Financial Year 2018/19 to 2023/24 passenger travel data projected onto a Network Rail shortest-path network using the centre-line track-model  to create visualisation for passenger journey numbers for the active rail stations across the British rail network.

### [2025-11-27 "Boundaries"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115620704879185226)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the twenty seventh #30MapsInAMonth is an animation showing the organisational operational boundaries boundaries of Network Rail using FOI data in a jazzy shaded colour scheme. This shows region, route, maintenance delivery unity and TME*.

\* if truth be told, I don't know what a TME is...

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the twenty ninth #30MapsInAMonth are two visualisations based on the [WorldPopProject]() 2030 projected population as 100m² raster data. The first shows the population of the Islands of Northern Europe and the second population change.

### [2025-11-30 "Makeover"](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115638218182948704)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
For the thirtieth* #30MapsInAMonth are maps showing the electrification of the global heavy-rail network based on the track-model and electrification and electrification tags from @openstreetmap

An electric railway is the least carbon-intensive way of moving freight and passengers over long distances**. More so where the electricity generation is from renewable sources.

While my plan was to make a global full-automated luxury high-speed railway for the final day, I chose to makeover the electrification maps because they seemed to be of most interest to people. 

Outwith the ORR ODM data map and they will get updated once next FY year's data is published...

### [2025-11-30 Outro to the Outro](https://fosstodon.org/@wnd/115638242713133373)

This has been hard work and probably took up more time than it should have. I have learnt stuff, and done bigger things that I had thought I could. Then again, quite a lot of what I had first thought I would post, I haven't often because it didn't fit the theme.

I also found myself at a point about a third-of-the-way through where I decided to get stuff made ahead of time. Which was good as it meant I finished the whole piece and had things to say each day that vaguely fitted the theme.

However, this didn't help with the actual daily posting itself. Where a combination of social-media file-size and resolution limits, my inability to articulate what it is that I have just done in words, a wish to post insanely large images and the general [yak-shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) of getting animations to work was probably the hardest part for me. No fun. Making things that are nice to look at, learning new stuff, and the general interaction and feedback kind makes it worth it though.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
After a brief period of activity, where I have posted a lot of maps for a month, I now plan to return to my usual approach of mostly ignoring posting anything unless I really have to.
