Or even what started this, other than I must have seem someone toot or post about the #30DayMapChallenge2025, and thoughts I could start and then give up when I felt like it.\n\n\n2025-11-01 “Points”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a vain attempt for #30MapsInAMonth here is a “Eurocentric” world map EPSG:3034 equal area projection using on WorldPopProject 1km² data showing projected population change between 2020 and 2030.\n#30DayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-02 “Lines”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second #30MapsInAMonth here is a map showing the heavy-rail network track-model and stations centred on the East Coast Mainline between South Yorkshire and the Fens. This uses the Rail Data Marketplace centre-line track-model published by Network Rail and the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) list of active stations.\n#rail #network #stations #30DayMapChallenge #EveryoneHomeSafeEveryDay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-02 Outro to the Intro\nAs I then said at the time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m never sure about this, but this year I decided to prepare for the #30DayMapChallenge by looking at things I have mapped over the years. My conclusion is I suffer from a rather myopic approach to the topic I visualise… #rail #Infrastructure #population #Europe\n\n\n\nFollowed by the revelation that there was a bit more to this than I had thought:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve now discovered that there are meant to be “themes” for each day in the #30DayMapChallenge but as that’s beyond me, it looks like I will be running a #fringe event instead…\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-03 “Polygons”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the third #30MapsInAMonth are three theoretical European full-automated luxury high-speed heavy-rail network maps based on population distribution. This uses H3 hierarchical hexagon library to aggregate @WorldPopProject population data into #polygons, creating a maximum spanning tree network using population-to-population edge-weights and names for major urban centres added using @EUCommission Global Human Settlement Layer data.\n#rail #network #HighSpeedRail #stations #30DayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-04 “Data”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the fourth #30MapsInAMonth is a map also based on population distribution and the shortest walking route to routes from the 2021 Office for National Statistics census Output Area locations to the stations centred on Sheffield. The line width is proportional to the aggregated population and the routes are based on based on @openstreetmap path data, and the station locations on Office of Rail and Road (ORR) active station list\n#rail #network #hinterland #stations #30DayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-05 “Earth”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the fifth #30MapsInAMonth is a map global map of places called “Wayne” based on #OpenStreetMap. It is arguably both “Waynes World” and my most “excellent” map.\n#PlaceNames #world #map #30DayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-06 “Dimensions”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the six #30MapsInAMonth are two maps the one-dimensional population distribution of Austria. Aggregating @WorldPopProject@mapstodon.space population and country boundary data, based in 100m slices, this shows the relative population distribution in the horizontal and vertical points on the compass.\n#population #Austria #30DayMapChallenge #OpenData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-07 “Accessibility”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the seventh #30MapsInAMonth are two maps showing the number of heavy railway services on week of 18 August 2025 for all stations within a 80km radius of the 20M Northern population centred around Leek in Staffordshire and the 22M South Eastern population centred on London.\n#rail #PublicTransport #train #services #OpenData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was created using the Network Rail Common Interface File (CIF) timetable and centre-line network-model made available on the Rail Data Marketplace https://raildata.org.uk/\nAlthough there is a similar population count within both areas there would appear to be a difference in provision of regional and urban heavy rail services between the two."

This is based on population density aggregating @WorldPopProject@mapstodon.space population data onto 43km edge-length hexagons, creating a network flow and overlaying with @CopernicusEU@respublicae.eu urban centre data.

The station name is scaled based on this aggregated number.\n#Passenger #Rail #ShortestTravel #Station #30dayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that, although there is a higher population in the South East and North West, this would suggest relatively fewer stations serving the population along the route of the Midlands Main Line (MML) or in the North East around the Tyne and Tees.\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-24 Hardest Visualisation\nThis visualisation caused the most debate its means, where I found it useful to refer to the post where\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(It’s based on a dataset where I worked out the shortest walking distances from the OA census and/or WorldPop 1km2 centroids data to heavy rail stations to end up with a watershed diagram as shared earlier If you then add up the population served by station and rank them, you get this…)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-25 “Hexagons”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the twenty fifth #30MapsInAMonth are a series of six maps showing WorldPopProject 1km² population data aggregated into a hierarchical set of scaled hexagons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some more at increasing levels of granularity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-26 “Transport”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the twenty sixth #30MapsInAMonth is a visualisation using the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) Financial Year 2018/19 to 2023/24 passenger travel data projected onto a Network Rail shortest-path network using the centre-line track-model to create visualisation for passenger journey numbers for the active rail stations across the British rail network.\n#Passenger #Rail #ReproducibleCode #30dayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual visualisation for the 2 587 stations on the mainline network are available here the code to generate this is here\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-27 “Boundaries”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the twenty seventh #30MapsInAMonth is an animation showing the organisational operational boundaries boundaries of Network Rail using FOI data in a jazzy shaded colour scheme. This shows region, route, maintenance delivery unity and TME*.\n* if truth be told, I don’t know what a TME is…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-28 “Black”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the twenty eighth #30MapsInAMonth are two visualisations based on the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) showing total and transport air pollution and emissions.\n#AirPollution #Emissions #OpenData #30dayMapChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-29 “Raster”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the twenty ninth #30MapsInAMonth are two visualisations based on the WorldPopProject 2030 projected population as 100m² raster data. The first shows the population of the Islands of Northern Europe and the second population change.\n#Raster #Population #Beethoven #GBR #IRE #OpenData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide a European perspective, if you would like a nine minute video of all the WorldPop raster data for all the countries in Europe, for a given value of “Europe”, ordered by three letter ISO code to the second movement (“Molto Vivace”) of Beethoven’s ninth symphony, here you go\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-11-30 “Makeover”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the thirtieth* #30MapsInAMonth are maps showing the electrification of the global heavy-rail network based on the track-model and electrification and electrification tags from @openstreetmap\nAn electric railway is the least carbon-intensive way of moving freight and passengers over long distances**. More so where the electricity generation is from renewable sources.\n* and final\n** words chosen more carefully\n#Decarbonization #Electrification #OpenData #30dayMapChallenge #PublicTransport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile my plan was to make a global full-automated luxury high-speed railway for the final day, I chose to makeover the electrification maps because they seemed to be of most interest to people.\nOutwith the ORR ODM data map and they will get updated once next FY year’s data is published…"

    "text": "How It Ends\nThis has been hard work and probably took up more time than it should have. Equall I did bigger things than I had thought I could. But quite a lot of what I first thought I would post I haven’t. Often because it didn’t fit the theme.\nI also found myself at a point about a half-way-through where I decided to get stuff made ahead of time. Which was good as it meant I finished the whole piece and had things to say each day that vaguely fitted the theme. However, this didn’t help with the actual daily posting itself.\nThis is hard, as a combination of social-media file-size and resolution limits, my inability to articulate what it is that I have just done in words, a wish to post insanely large images and the general yak-shaving of getting animations to work was probably trickiest bit for me. No fun.\nBut this is where I am now\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a brief period of activity, where I have posted a lot of maps for a month, I now plan to return to my usual approach of mostly ignoring posting anything unless I really have to.\n\n\n\nMaking things that are nice to look at, learning new stuff, and the general interaction and feedback kind makes it worth it though.\nTL;DR some people liked it and I learnt some stuff. Maybe that’s enough."
