Then again, quite a lot of what I had first thought I would post, I haven’t often because it didn’t fit the theme.\nI also found myself at a point about a third-of-the-way through where I decided to get stuff made ahead of time. Which was good as it meant I finished the whole piece and had things to say each day that vaguely fitted the theme.\nHowever, this didn’t help with the actual daily posting itself. Where a combination of social-media file-size and resolution limits, my inability to articulate what it is that I have just done in words, a wish to post insanely large images and the general yak-shaving of getting animations to work was probably the hardest part for me. No fun. Making things that are nice to look at, learning new stuff, and the general interaction and feedback kind makes it worth it though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a brief period of activity, where I have posted a lot of maps for a month, I now plan to return to my usual approach of mostly ignoring posting anything unless I really have to."
